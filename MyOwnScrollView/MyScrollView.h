@interface MyScrollView : UIView

@property CGSize contentSize;





//Now, lets build a ScrollView.
//Add a class called MyScrollView which inherits from UIView
//
//You need to add two things to your custom UIView
//
//A CGSize property called contentSize
//A PanGestureRecognizer
//In the method that handles events from the PanGestureRecognizer, look for how far your have panned. Then, move (translate) the view's frame, but do not permit values that would violate contentSize.
//
//Refactor your code so that the boxes are added as subviews to MyScrollView and set the contentSize.
//
//Note: We implemented the basics of UIScrollView but there is a lot more to the real UIScrollView than just this. Momentum scrolling, bouncing, scroll indicators, zooming, and delegate methods are just some of the features we have not implemented here.
